üìù Credit Score Analysis Report
1. Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing credit card default data to identify patterns, handle missing values, and build predictive models. The ultimate goal is to evaluate individuals‚Äô creditworthiness using machine learning techniques.

2. Data Loading and Setup
The dataset was loaded from Google Drive using Google Colab. Core libraries used include:

Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

Warnings module to suppress unnecessary alerts

python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
3. Handling Missing Data
Missing data was identified and appropriately handled using imputation techniques. This step is critical for preventing bias or errors in model training.

Numerical columns: Filled using mean/median values

Categorical columns: Handled with mode or specific encoding strategies

Visualization was used to detect gaps and confirm successful treatment.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Various plots were generated to understand the relationships between features like:

Age

Education level

Marital status

Payment history

Credit limit

Heatmaps and pairplots were employed to detect correlations and multicollinearity.

5. Modeling
A range of machine learning models were explored:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Train-test split was performed, followed by model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

The model with the best performance (likely Random Forest or SVM depending on your exact results) was chosen as the final one.

6. Conclusion
The analysis successfully predicted credit card default likelihood with a reasonable accuracy. The project highlights:

Importance of data cleaning

Power of visual EDA

Effectiveness of ensemble models like Random Forest

Further improvements could include:

Hyperparameter tuning

Feature engineering

Cross-validation for robust evaluation
